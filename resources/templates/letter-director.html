			Emigrating from East Africa, Ethiopia, nineteen years ago to the United States, I was amazed by the opportunities one could get in this country to achieve her or his goals.
 Being a female and growing in Africa, I was suppressed in every level - from cultural to governmental - not to work toward my dream. Ever since I came to the United States, I have used every opportunity to improve my educational and professional growth while building a family.
 I attended undergraduate and graduate school while working full time and raising three children. All while well being involved in my community, providing volunteer services. Though I have a decent profession, and the luxury to live in my adopted country, I always felt obligated to help the country  that gave me my early childhood, education and an incredible culture.

			I started my search for an organization that conduct a medical mission trip to Ethiopia. In 2015 I joined an organization called Ethiopia Cardiology, which provides a cardiology fellowship program to interns in Jimma and Bahirdar Universities. The organization asked me to teach the echocardiography portion of the program and I graciously accepted this offer and started volunteering to teach basic echocardiography to the cardiology Fellowship. I provided online reading materials, traveled onsite for hands-on training and critiqued the daily echocardiograms they performed online, with feedback provided. This helped the fellows to quickly improve their scanning skills to a professional level in a short period of time.

			While this teaching system was the most successful and effective to develop local cardiac professionals in Ethiopia, the program got interrupted due to unrest in the country in 2017. The team I was volunteering with are all U.S citizens and received a letter from the U.S Embassy in Ethiopia not to travel outside of Addis Ababa. Due to this problem, the team got frustrated and changed their direction to South America. Though many valiant efforts to keep the team on course for Ethiopia were made, the team ultimately chose to journey towards South America. Attempts were made to have me in South America, but it goes without saying that I chose to help Ethiopia. The image of the 14 years old girl heart failure patient due to untreated rheumatic heart disease that I met in Jimma in 2015 still haunts me till this day. I made a promise to myself that I will continue to do my very best to help bring better cardiac care services in Ethiopia.

			While I was very disappointed with the situation, I decided not to give up and determined to do what I can by myself. I started collecting used cardiology books, contacting individual cardiologists in Ethiopia as well as the Health minister to connect me with the right institution so I can continue to teach. I succeed on this aspect and was able to connect with the Children’s Cardiac Center, Tikur Ambesa Emergency Department and St. Paul’s Hospital. Visiting these hospitals and working with the cardiologists, I saw the critical need of cardiac sonographers. I raised this concern to administrative leaders of the hospitals visited. However, their response was that the idea may not be accepted by the cardiologist.

			A couple of months after I came back from Ethiopia, I connected with Dr. Demeke at St. Peter’s hospital. We started discussing regarding feta/pediatric echocardiography training. He rose the very idea that was rejected by others and asked me if I can help train cardiac sonographers in his hospital. I was thrilled beyond imagine to find a physician like him who was dedicated and passionate to teach others. We immediately started working on the logistics. I recruited as many professionals who would be volunteering to teach from the organization I work for and worked in creating the online platform, while Dr. Demeke was working on recruiting trainees and facilitating the candidate selection process. I am grateful to team up with a professional as passionate in helping others as he is. Though the process took longer than I wanted it to, we are now ready to start the teaching.

			The reason why I needed to tell you this story is that I want you to know this program is a product of  passion for cardiac profession and a genuine heart to help Ethiopians. In return, we want you to be as passionate and determined as we are. As the 1st cohort of this program, we want you to succeed and become ambassadors for the advancement of cardiac care in Ethiopia. Additionally, I can’t stress the importance of TEAMWORK in this program, as well as in your daily work. Working in one of the busiest pediatric echocardiography laboratories with many sonographers, nurses, and physicians, I learned a great deal about the value of teamwork. Teamwork is the core of healthcare services. I work in a team that has people with different cultures and backgrounds. Learning their culture and personality helps me to know how to approach them and make them an active member and a great contributor to our team.

			As a healthcare professional, it is also important to go above and beyond just executing an assigned task. Bring new ideas to make your workplace to run more efficient in providing quality care to your patients and produce a great outcome. In this program, working and studying together are the key to success. Most of our assignments will be a group based and we would like to see 100% participation by everyone. Dr. Demeke has also spoke very highly of you and has no doubt that you’ll make him proud. Again, I welcome you to your first class and looking forward to working with you.
