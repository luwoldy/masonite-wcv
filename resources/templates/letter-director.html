			Emigrating from East Africa, Ethiopia, nineteen years ago to the United  States, I was wowed by the opportunities of one can get in this country  to achieve her or his goal. Being a female and growing in Africa, I was  suppressed in every level - from cultural to governmental - not to work  toward my dream. Ever since I came to the United States, I have used  every opportunity to improve my educational and professional growth  while building a family. I attended undergraduate and graduate school  while working full time and raising three children as well as being  involved in my community providing volunteer services. Though I have a  decent profession and life to live in my adopted country, my need to  help my country of origin that gave me early education and an incredible  culture with what I can, started growing inside me by the day. I started my search for an organization that conduct a medical mission  trip to Ethiopia. In 2015 I joined an organization called Ethiopia  Cardiology, which provides a cardiology fellowship program to interns in  Jimma and Bahirdar Universities. They asked me to teach the  echocardiography portion of the program. I graciously accepted this  offer and started volunteering to teach basic echocardiography to this  cardiology Fellows. I provided online reading materials, travelled  onsite for hands-on training and critic their daily echocardiograms they  perform online and provided feedback. This helped the fellows to  quickly improve their scanning skills to a professional level in a short  period of time. While this teaching system was the most successful and effective to  develop local cardiac professionals in Ethiopia, the program got  interrupted due to unrest in the country in 2017. The team I was  volunteering with are all U.S citizens and received a letter from the  U.S Embassy in Ethiopia not to travel outside of Addis Ababa. Due to  this problem, the team got frustrated and changed their direction to  South America. I did everything I could to keep them coming to Ethiopia,  but the problem was beyond my ability to convince. They actually tried  to convince me to join their volunteer team in South America. Little  that they know, I’ll choose Ethiopia with all its problems. The image of  the 14 years old girl heart failure patient due to untreated rheumatic  heart disease that I met in Jimma in 2015 still haunts me till today. I  made a promise to myself that I will continue to do my very best to help  bring a better cardiac care services in Ethiopia. While I was very disappointed with the situation, I decided not to give  up and determined to do what I can by myself. I started collecting used  cardiology books, contacting individual cardiologists in Ethiopia as  well as the Health minister to connect me with the right institution so I  can continue to teach. I succeed on this aspect and was able to connect  with the Children’s Cardiac Center, Tikur Ambesa Emergency Department  and St. Paul’s Hospital. Visiting these hospitals and working with the  cardiologists, I saw the critical need of cardiac sonographers. I’ve  raised this idea to administrative leaders of the hospitals I visited.  However, their response was that the idea may not be accepted by the  cardiologist. A couple of months after I came back from Ethiopia, I have connected  with Dr. Demeke at St. Peter’s hospital. We started discussing regarding  feta/pediatric echocardiography training. He rose the very idea that  was rejected by others and asked me if I can help train cardiac  sonographers in his hospital. I was thrilled beyond imagined to find a  physician like him who is dedicated and passionate to teach others. We  immediately started working on the logistics. I recruited as many  professionals who would be volunteering to teach from the organization I  work for and worked in creating the online platform, while Dr. Demeke  was working on recruiting trainees and facilitating the candidate  selection process. I am grateful to team up with a professional as  passionate in helping others as he is. In today’s character trait, it is  not easy to find people who share your mission, passion and sense of  vision and work for it. Though the process took longer than I wanted it  too, we are now ready to start the teaching. The reason why I needed to tell you the story is that I want you to know  this program is created by passion for cardiac profession and a genuine  heart to help Ethiopians. In return, we want you to be as passionate  and determined as we are. As the 1st cohort of this program, we want you  to succeed and become ambassadors for the advancement of cardiac care  in Ethiopia. Additionally, I can’t stress the importance of TEAMWORK in this program,  as well as in your daily work. In my experience, working in one of the  busiest pediatric echocardiography laboratories with many sonographers,  nurses, and physicians, I learned a great deal about the value of  teamwork. Teamwork is the core of healthcare services. I work in a team  that has people with different cultures and backgrounds. Learning their  culture and personality helps me to know how to approach them and make  them an active member and a great contributor to our team. As a  healthcare professional, it is also important to go above and beyond  just executing an assigned task. Bring new ideas to make your workplace  to run more efficient in providing quality care to your patients and  produce a great outcome. In this program, work and study together for a  better success. Most of our assignments will be a group assignment and  we would like to see a 100% participation for every work by everyone.  Dr. Demeke has also spoke very highly of you and no doubt that you’ll  make him proud. Again, I welcome you to your first class and looking forward to working  with you.  Kindly, Lily E. Berhe Program Director at WCV
